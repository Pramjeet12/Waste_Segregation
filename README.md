## Introduction

Waste segregation is a critical step in promoting recycling and efficient waste management. This project leverages deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the classification of waste materials. By accurately identifying and categorizing waste, we aim to facilitate better recycling practices and reduce the environmental impact of waste.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various waste types. You can find a suitable dataset from:

    Kaggle Waste Classification Dataset

## Model 

The CNN model architecture includes:

    Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction.

    Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.  

    Fully connected layers for classification.

    Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Results

The model attained an accuracy of **86.12%** on the test dataset.
